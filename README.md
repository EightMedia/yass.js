yass.js
=========

Yet Another SrcSet implementation.

### How to use it

Add yass.js just after the last img tag on your page. 
For better user experience you can add some css to hide the images with a srcset onload.
Check the /demo directory for a sample implementation.

Yass works from a mobile-first perspective, so the properties are seen as a minimal value.
So 800w should be visible on a 800px or wider screen.

### Notes

Yass.js is small, under 1kb when minified and gzipped...
