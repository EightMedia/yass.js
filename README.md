yass.js
=========

Yet Another SrcSet implementation.

## How to use it

Add the srcset.js just after the last img tag on your page.
For better user experience you can add some css to hide the images with a srcset onload.

For now, check example.html for a demo implementation.

Yass.js is small, only 490 bytes minified and gzipped...
